Hello!

Thank you for the listening to our presentation and taking the time to give feedback on work. Ok, so app.py is where python is launched and it will open index.html. This linkes to all of out logic files:

logicjessica.js - Where the Chloropleth is initialized to it's respective map. It pulls data from geojson file try.js.
logicmika.js - where we initialize CO2 heatmap and use the slider to change the data. 
logic-scotty.js - just became place for api-key
population.js - where the circlemarker map is initialized. 

index.html - where Emily initializes d3 graph. script section. 

App.py (Flask is connected) and where we load in data and poast to html. Did not read in out of time sake, but works. 

It appears that population data is representing itself in multiple graphs instead of the correct data. So on the d3 circles one it is incorrect, and then for cloropleth it is not showing accurate as well. We understand that this will hurt our project's validity.
